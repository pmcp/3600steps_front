    <h1>HELP!</h1>

    Dear Walker,

Technology is what it is: fallible, fragile. Just like the human beings we are that built it.

Let that not keep you from continuing your Walk. If the 3600 steps module fails to send your images or shows error messages, follow these steps:

Continue your Walk as you would have (counting, searching for something which affects you).
Make the images using your camera's phone, just like you always do, but stick to the protocol of the Photographic-Therapeutic Walks.
When you have finished your walk and have access to Wi-Fi, send your images to images@3600steps.be*
Delete the images from your phone after transferring them.
Have a great Walk,

Kasper
